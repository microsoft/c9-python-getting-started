# Error handling

Error handling in Python is managed through the use of [try/except/finally](https://docs.python.org/3.7/reference/compound_stmts.html#except)

Python has numerous [built-in exceptions](https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/exceptions.html). When creating `except` blocks, they need to be created from most specific to most generic according to the [hierarchy](https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/exceptions.html#exception-hierarchy).
