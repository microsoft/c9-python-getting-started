# Comments

Comments are ignored when code is executed.

“”” Docstrings ”””

The docstrings are declared using “””triple double quotes”””.
It gives programmers an easy way of adding quick notes with every Python module, function, class, and method.
Note: The strings defined using triple-quotation mark are docstring in Python. However, it might appear to you as a regular comment.
As long as the string is not assigned to a variable, Python will read the code, but then ignore it, and you have made a multiline comment.
