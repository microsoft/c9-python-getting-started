print('Hello world')

#The below single-quote string contains an apostrophe which will produce an invalid syntax error.
print('It's a small world after all') <-- syntax error
#To fix this, you can use either an escape sequence character or double quotes.

print('It\'s a small world after all') #escape sequence char fix
print("It's a small world after all") #double quotes fix
