# Date values

The [datetime module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html) contains a number of classes for manipulating dates and times.

Date and time types:

- `date` stores year, month, and day
- `time` stores hour, minute, and second
- `datetime` stores year, month, day, hour, minute, and second
- `timedelta` a duration of time between two dates, times, or datetimes

When naming variables follow the PEP-8 Style Guide for Python Code
