# More Python for beginners

## Overview

When we created [Python for beginners](https://aka.ms/pythonbeginnerseries) we knew we wouldn't be able to cover everything in Python. We focused on the features which are core to getting started with the language. But, of course, we left some items off the list. Well, we're back for more! We created another set of videos to highlight more features, including a couple of "cutting edge" items like `async/await`. These skills will allow you to continue to grow as a Python developer.

### What you'll learn

- Creating classes and objects
- Asynchronous development
- Working with the filesystem

### What we don't cover

- Programming concepts like [object-oriented design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_design)
- Database access

## Prerequisites

- [An understanding of git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2)
- [An understanding of Python](https://aka.ms/pythonbeginnerseries)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com?WT.mc_id=python-c9-niner) or another code editor

### Setup steps

- [Create a virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html)

``` bash
# Windows
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate

# Linux or macOS
python3 -m venv venv
. ./venv/bin/activate
```

- Install the packages for Async/Await

``` bash
# Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Linux or macOS
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
