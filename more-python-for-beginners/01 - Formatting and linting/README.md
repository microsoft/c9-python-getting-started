# Style Guidelines

## Formatting

Formatting makes code readable and easier to debug.

## Documentation

- [PEP 8](https://pep8.org/) is a set of coding conventions for Python code
- [Docstring](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/) is the standard for documenting a module, function, class or method definition

## Linting

Linting helps you identify formatting and convention issues in your Python code

- [Pylint](https://www.pylint.org/) Pylint is a linter for Python to help enforce coding standards and check for errors in Python code
- [Linting Python in Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/linting) will show you how to enable litners in VS Code
- [Type hints](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html) allow some interactive development environments and linters to enforce types
