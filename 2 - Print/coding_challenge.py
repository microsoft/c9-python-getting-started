# Here's a challenge for you to help you practice
# See if you can fix the code below 

# print the message
print('Why won't this line of code print')

# As there is a single quote which will throw an error of invalid syntax.
# We will have to escape the single quote using \
print('Why won\'t this line of code print')

# print the message
prnit('This line fails too!')

# The function being used here is print
print('This line fails too!')

# print the message
print "I think I know how to fix this one"

# Missing parenthesis to call print
print ("I think I know how to fix this one")

# print the name entered by the user
input('Please tell me your name: ')
print(name)

# We need to store the String (name) in a variable
name = input('Please tell me your name: ')
print(name)
