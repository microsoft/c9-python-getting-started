# Evaluating accuracy of a model using calculations

Playing with individual values isn't the best way to test a model. Fortunately, [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/) provides tools for automated testing an analysis.

## Common functions

- [metrics](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html?highlight=metrics#module-sklearn.metrics) includes functions and metrics that can be used for data science including measuring accuracy of models
- [mean_squared_error](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.mean_squared_error.html#sklearn.metrics.mean_squared_error) returns the mean squared error, a measure used to measure accuracy of linear regression models
- [r2_score](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.r2_score.html#sklearn.metrics.r2_score) returns the R^2 regression score, a measure used to measure accuracy of linear regression models

## NumPy

[NumPy](https://numpy.org/) is a package for scientific computing with Python

### Common functions

- [sqrt](https://numpy.org/doc/1.18/reference/generated/numpy.sqrt.html?highlight=sqrt#numpy.sqrt) returns the square root of a value
