# Calling APIs

You can call functions called by other programs hosted on web servers.
[Microsoft Azure Cognitive Services](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-ca/azure/cognitive-services/) contain a number of APIs you can call from your code to add intelligence to your apps and websites.

In the code example you call the [Analyze Image](https://westus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/5adf991815e1060e6355ad44/operations/56f91f2e778daf14a499e1fa0) function of the [Computer Vision](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/computer-vision/)

Calling the API requires
- [API Key](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-ca/try/cognitive-services/) to give you permission to call the API
- Address or Endpoint of the service
- function name of method to call as listed in the [API documentation](https://westus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/5adf991815e1060e6355ad44/operations/56f91f2e778daf14a499e1fa)
- function parameters as listed in the [API documentation](https://westus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/5adf991815e1060e6355ad44/operations/56f91f2e778daf14a499e1fa)
- HTTP Headers as listed in the [API documentation](https://westus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/5adf991815e1060e6355ad44/operations/56f91f2e778daf14a499e1fa)
