# Collections

Collections are groups of items. Python supports several types of collections. Three of the most common are dictionaries, lists and arrays.

## Lists

[Lists](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/introduction.html#lists) are a collection of items. Lists can be expanded or contracted as needed, and can contain any data type. Lists are most commonly used to store a single column collection of information, however it is possible to [nest lists](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#nested-list-comprehensions)
## Arrays

[Arrays](https://docs.python.org/3/library/array.html) are similar to lists, however are designed to store a uniform basic data type, such as integers or floating point numbers.

## Dictionaries

[Dictionaries](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#dictionaries) are key/value pairs of a collection of items. Unlike a list where items can only be accessed by their index or value, dictionaries use keys to identify each item.
