# Functions

Functions allow you to take code that is repeated and move it to a module that can be called when needed. Functions are defined with the `def` keyword and must be declared before the function is called in your code. Functions can accept parameters and return values.

```python
def functionname(parameter):
    # code to execute
    return value
```
