# JSON

Many APIs return data in [JSON](https://json.org/), JavaScript Object Notation. JSON is a standard format that can is readable by humans and parsed or generated by code. 

JSON is built on two structures:
- collections of key/value pairs
- lists of values

JSON Linters will format JSON so it easier to read by a human. The following website have JSON linters:
- [JSONLint](https://jsonlint.com/)
- [ConvertJson.com](http://www.convertjson.com/jsonlint.htm)
- [JSON schema linter](https://www.json-schema-linter.com/)

Python includes a [json](https://docs.python.org/2/library/json.html) module which helps you encode and decode JSON
