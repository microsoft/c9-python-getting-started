# Challenge #1
# Create an Azure Custom Vision Service 
# Analyze an image and return the JSON describing the image.
# call_api.py is a completed solution, but it will not run unless
# you do the following:
#   Create a Custom Vision Service in Azure
#   Update the Key 
#   Update the address of your service
#   Update the image file and location

# Bonus Challenge 
# Your skills are growing, it's time to start trying to figure things out on your own
# based on documentation. You have already called one function of the Computer Vision Service
# Now try calling another
# Instead of calling the analyze method of the service, try calling the OCR method 
# Here is some helpful documentation
# https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/Computer-vision/concept-recognizing-text#ocr-optical-character-recognition-api
# https://westus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/5adf991815e1060e6355ad44/operations/56f91f2e778daf14a499e1fc
# Use the documentation to figure out
#    The correct function name for the address
#    The parameters you need to pass the function
#    The HTTP Headers required    
# Pass in an image containing text
# The JSON returned will contain the string of text in the image
# Good luck!
