name = ['Christopher', 'Susan']  ## list of names

for nm in name:   ## This will iterate(in simple words it will fetch the values) the name list one by one till the last element/values reached
	print(nm)

OUTPUT :
	Christopher
	Susan
	
# For better understanding just take a list of numbers( i.e, [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]) and iterate this list using a for loop
